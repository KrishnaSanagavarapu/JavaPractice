Java Notes

Packages in Java

- Package in java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub classes, sub packages and interfaces. 
-A java package is a group of similar types of classes,interfaces and sub packages

There are two types of packages
1.User Defined Packages
2.InBuilt Packages

Examples of Built-in Packages

some built in packages in java are lang,awt,javax,swing,net,io,util,sql,etc


Advantages of Packages
-Resusability
-Better Organisation of Code
-Name Conficts

What is OOPS ? Define OOPS?
OOPs - refers to a programming methodology based on objects instead of just functions and procedures.

OOPs Concepts?

Abstraction
-Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details and describing things in simple terms.

Encapsulation
-Encapsulation is the technique used to implement abstraction in object-oriented programming. 
-Encapsulation is used for access restriction to class members and methods
-Access Modifiers - Privat,Public,Protected,Default

Polymorphism
-Polymorphism is the concept where an object behaves differently in different situations. 
-There are two types of polymorphism – compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
-Compile-time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading.
-Runtime polymorphism is implemented when we have “IS-A” relationship between objects.

Inheritance
-Inheritance is the mechanism of code reuse. The object that is getting inherited is called superclass and the object that inherits the superclass is called subclass.
-We use extends keyword in java to implement inheritance.

Association
-Association refers to the relationship between multiple objects. 
-It refers to how objects are related to each other and how they are using each other's functionality. -Composition and aggregation are two types of association.

Aggregation
Aggregation is a weak association.
Aggregation is also a “has-a” relationship. What distinguishes it from composition, that it doesn't involve owning. 

 Composition
The composition is the strong type of association
Composition is a strong kind of “has-a” relationship because the containing object owns it.
It means that if we destroy the owner object, its members also will be destroyed with it.
